                    <p class="plain-text">Modestep began work on their debut album during early January 2011, with their debut single "Feel Good" being released in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2011; managing to reach the BBC Radio 1 A Playlist during the weeks prior to release. The single was released as part of a 3-track extended play, including another track entitled "Bite The Hand". On 13 February, the single debuted at number 38 on the UK Singles Chart, also reaching number 5 on the independent releases chart and number 6 on the dance releases chart. The music video of the new version of their single "Sunlight" was released on YouTube on 3 July, passing 1 million views within four days, also making the Radio 1 A-list and debuting at number 16 in the UK charts. "To The Stars" has also made it onto the Radio 1 A-list and was released on 6 November. Their fourth single "Show Me A Sign" made its YouTube debut on 19 March 2012 and was released on 6 May 2012. They were also a support act for Lostprophets Weapons tour in mid-2012 and have been received extremely well by audiences. In July 2012, the fifth single from Evolution Theory, entitled "Another Day", was aired on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Modestep had previously performed this song to open their set when supporting Lostprophets on their spring UK tour. Just before the song was aired, Tony Friend revealed in an interview that Modestep hoped to release their debut album on 3 September 2012. After the album was pushed back to 14 January 2013, it was pushed back yet again to 11 February 2013.</p>

                    <p class="plain-text">Modestep have announced via their social pages that they are now in the studio working on new material. On 16 October 2013 they began work on the first track from their then-forthcoming second studio album. In December 2013, the band embarked on the Foot Locker tour in Europe, promoting popular shoe retail store Foot Locker. On 14 January 2014, Tsang and Curtis both left the band to pursue their own careers in the music industry. Despite this the album was still scheduled and a world tour is expected with the two new members, Pat Lundy (ex-drummer of the iconic band Funeral For A Friend) and Kyle Deek (age 22) who joined in the spring of 2014. Starting in mid-2014, Josh and Tony began their recurring appearances in TheSyndicateProject's YouTube series, "Mianite", a series of videos based around the game Minecraft.
                        The band released a new single titled "Snake" for free download in mid-January 2015. On 22 February 2015, they announced the title and track listing for their second studio album, to be released on 25 May 2015. London Road, released through Modestep's own record label Max Records, features collaborations with FuntCase, Teddy Killerz, Culprate, The Partysquad, Trolley Snatcha, Big Narstie, Flowdan, Frisco and more. On 14 May 2015, Modestep announced the release of one new song per day until the full album release.</p>

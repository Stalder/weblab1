                <p>Modestep are a dubstep and electronic rock band from London that formed in 2010. Their debut album Evolution Theory was released on 11 February 2013, including its five singles: "Feel Good", "Sunlight", "To the Stars", "Show Me a Sign" and "Another Day". Modestep's second album, London Road, was released on 25 May 2015.</p>
                <h2>Evolution theory</h2>
                <p>Modestep began work on their debut album during early January 2011, with their debut single "Feel Good" being released in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2011; managing to reach the BBC Radio 1 A Playlist during the weeks prior to release.[citation needed] The single was released as part of a 3-track extended play, including another track entitled "Bite The Hand". On 13 February, the single debuted at number 38 on the UK Singles Chart,[3] also reaching number 5 on the independent releases chart[4] and number 6 on the dance releases chart.[5] The music video of the new version of their single "Sunlight" was released on YouTube on 3 July, passing 1 million views within four days, also making the Radio 1 A-list and debuting at number 16 in the UK charts. "To The Stars" has also made it onto the Radio 1 A-list and was released on 6 November. Their fourth single "Show Me A Sign" made its YouTube debut on 19 March 2012 and was released on 6 May 2012.[6] They were also a support act for Lostprophets Weapons tour in mid-2012 and have been received extremely well by audiences. In July 2012, the fifth single from Evolution Theory, entitled "Another Day", was aired on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Modestep had previously performed this song to open their set when supporting Lostprophets on their spring UK tour. Just before the song was aired, Tony Friend revealed in an interview that Modestep hoped to release their debut album on 3 September 2012. After the album was pushed back to 14 January 2013, it was pushed back yet again to 11 February 2013.</p>
